Hello stranger!

I occasionally leave my thoughts, rants & publish my research on this blog.

I'm also the founder of PSP webtech, a Sofia-based software company part of PSP UK Group Ltd. PSP is a software solutions business, producing software that makes a real difference. We have over a decade of experience in design, production and delivery of software solutions for small business. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanangeloff/).
