How often do you use your `Caps Lock` key? I've had it remapped to act as another `Ctrl` for years, but never actually used it as such. So how about using it for something useful, like keyboard layout switching (e.g., US <-> Bulgarian)?

It's very common amongst the people I know to map left `Ctrl+Shift` or `Alt+Shift` to change keyboard layouts.
However, this can often get in the way especially when working with editors such as Vim or Emacs -- one moment you are typing with Latin letters, next you have *magically* switched to Cyrillic. You then find yourself having to shift from editing to sorting out whatever has gone wrong.

One more thing. The keyboard layout indicator in your OS -- doesn't that just waste space? Call me minimalistic, I prefer my screen free of clutter.

How to use the epic keyboard layout change mode:

1. Open *System Settings*. In Unity or Gnome Shell just look for it in the launcher.
2. Find the *Keyboard* applet.
3. Select *Layout Settings*.
4. Select *Options...* under *Layouts*.
5. Customise:
   - *Caps Lock key behaviour*: leave at *Default*.
   - *Key(s) to change layout*: tick *Caps Lock* only.
   - *Use keyboard LED to show alternative layout*: tick *Caps Lock* only.

...and there you have it. Whenever you want to use your alternative layout, press `Caps Lock` and your keyboard LED indicator should light up indicating you are now typing in a different language.

I just need to find a good use for `Num Lock` now...

Does this work in other OSes? Let me know in the comments below.
