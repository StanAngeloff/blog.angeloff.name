The design team at Canonical has decided to refresh the default theme in Ubuntu for its LTS release to feature light menus from light sources and dark menus from dark sources.

If you are anything like me, the decision didn't probably go well with you either. I've been hacking on a 'proper' port back to dark menus, those interested can find the [source and instructions](https://github.com/StanAngeloff/AmbianceOneiric) available on GitHub.

I've [kept the changes](https://github.com/StanAngeloff/AmbianceOneiric/commit/99835042fcf1dc037134b9c7330f905451eccc9d) to a minimum so you'd still get all other improvements, such as less prominent controls for windows out of focus.
